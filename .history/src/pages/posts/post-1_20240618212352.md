# My First Akechi Post

Published on: 2024-06-18

Welcome to my _new blog_ about Akechi! This is the first post of how much I love Akechi.

## What I've accomplished

1. **明明经**: First, 每天早晨诵读明明经一个小时

2. **看明明视频**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **做明明视频**: AI翻唱，只为听到明明唱歌

## What's next

I'll tell the whole world that I love Akechi!
