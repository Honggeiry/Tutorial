# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-06-18

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! This is the first post of how much I love Akechi.

## What I've accomplished

1. **明明经**: First, 每天早晨诵读明明经一个小时

2. **看明明视频**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **做明明视频**: AI翻唱

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
